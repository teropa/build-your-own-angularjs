# Build Your Own AngularJS

This repository contains the AngularJS implementation built during the course of the book [Build Your Own AngularJS](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular), as well as the errata for the book.

## Code

To make following along easier, commits are ordered to match the order of events in the book. Each commit message references the corresponding section title in the book. Note that this means the history of this repository may change as the book is revised.

There is also a tag for each chapter, pointing to the state of the codebase at the end of that chapter.

## Errata

The [Issues](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs/issues) section of this repository contains the book's errata. 

If you find bugs, typos, mistakes, or other issues that should be improved, I would love to hear about it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
